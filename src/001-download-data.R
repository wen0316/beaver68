#
# Purpose:
#   Download the raw WRDS tables needed to replicate Beaver (1968), "The
#   Information Content of Annual Earnings Announcements," JAR 6, 67-92.
#
#   Beaver asked whether earnings announcements convey new information to
#   the market. His evidence: in the week of an annual earnings
#   announcement, both trading VOLUME and the VARIABILITY of stock
#   returns spike relative to their non-announcement levels. So we need
#   three ingredients:
#
#     1. Earnings announcement dates      -> Compustat fundq (rdq)
#     2. Daily returns and volume         -> CRSP daily stock file
#     3. A market return to adjust by     -> CRSP value-weighted index
#
#   plus the CCM link table to get from Compustat's gvkey to CRSP's permno.
#
# Based on:
#   The choice of tables and the sample screens follow Chapter 12 of
#   Gow, I. D., and T. Ding. 2024. Empirical Research in Accounting: Tools
#   and Methods. Chapman & Hall/CRC. Read the chapter alongside this file:
#   https://iangow.github.io/far_book/beaver68.html
#
# Inputs:
#   WRDS PostgreSQL endpoint. Credentials come from your OS keyring
#   (service `wrds`, keys `username` and `password`), stored once by
#   project_setup() the first time you run this script.
#
# Outputs (to RAW_DATA_DIR):
#   ccm-link.parquet     CCM link table (gvkey -> permno)
#   fundq-raw.parquet    Compustat quarterly fundamentals (incl. rdq)
#   crsp-dsf-v2.parquet  CRSP daily returns, volume, price, shares out
#   crsp-index.parquet   CRSP value-weighted market index returns
#
# Notes:
#   - Skip-if-exists guards mean re-running this script does NOT re-pull
#     anything already on disk. Delete a file in RAW_DATA_DIR to force a
#     refresh.
#   - Runtime: the CRSP daily pull is the long pole. Expect ~15-25
#     minutes back to 1970. See FIRST_DATE below if you want it faster.
#   - RAW vs DERIVED: raw pulls land in RAW_DATA_DIR and are never
#     modified. Everything scripts 2-4 compute lands in DATA_DIR. That
#     split is what makes a replication cheap -- someone else can rerun
#     scripts 2-5 against your preserved raw inputs without touching WRDS.

# Setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# renv has already installed these at the exact versions in renv.lock, so we
# just load them. If any of these errors with "there is no package called ...",
# run src/000-check-setup.R -- it will install everything the project needs.

# First-time setup: prompts for your data paths and WRDS credentials, then
# writes .env. Idempotent -- an instant no-op once .env exists, so you can
# leave this call here forever.
#
# IMPORTANT: run this script INTERACTIVELY in RStudio the first time
# (Ctrl+Enter through it, or Ctrl+A then Ctrl+Enter). project_setup()
# needs a live console to prompt you. After .env exists, run-all.R works.

# Sample period knob -----------------------------------------------------------

# How far back to pull CRSP daily data. This is the single biggest driver
# of download time and disk usage.
#
#   "1970-01-01"  full history; supports the by-decade plots. ~20 min.
#   "2000-01-01"  much faster (~5 min), still gives you two decades.
#
# Beaver's own sample was 1961-1965, which predates the CRSP daily file
# (daily CRSP starts in July 1962 and Compustat's rdq field is sparse
# before the 1970s). So we cannot replicate his exact sample -- we
# re-run his RESEARCH DESIGN on modern data. That gap is itself one of
# the discussion questions.

# Connect to WRDS --------------------------------------------------------------

# To change them later:
#   keyring::key_set("wrds", "username")

# Download the CCM link table --------------------------------------------------

# Compustat identifies firms by gvkey; CRSP by permno. The CCM link table
# maps between them, with validity date ranges (linkdt / linkenddt),
# because the mapping changes over time as firms merge, spin off, or
# re-list.
#
# It is small (~100K rows), so a plain collect() is fine -- that pulls the
# whole table into R memory in one shot.

# Download Compustat fundq -----------------------------------------------------

# fundq is Compustat's quarterly fundamentals file. The field we care most
# about is `rdq` -- the Report Date of Quarterly Earnings, i.e. the date
# the earnings announcement hit the wire. That is our event date.
#
# The four filters below are the standard Compustat screen and you should
# apply them on essentially every Compustat pull:
#   indfmt  = 'INDL'  industrial format (vs 'FS' financial services)
#   datafmt = 'STD'   standardized data (vs restated / preliminary)
#   popsrc  = 'D'     domestic population source
#   consol  = 'C'     consolidated statements
# Without them you get duplicate rows per firm-quarter.
#
# We keep a few extra fundamentals (saleq, ibq, atq, prccq, cshoq) beyond
# what the base replication strictly needs. They cost almost nothing to
# carry and give you raw material for an extension -- e.g. splitting the
# sample on firm size, or on whether earnings were good news or bad news.

# Download CRSP daily stock file -----------------------------------------------

# This is the big one -- roughly 100 million rows for the full history.
# Rather than collect() it into R memory (which would likely blow up your
# session), download_parquet() streams it from the server in batches and
# appends each batch to the parquet file as a row group. Peak memory is
# one batch, not the whole table. See utils.R if you want the details.
#
# WHY THESE COLUMNS:
#   dlyret        daily return -- Beaver's return-variability measure
#   dlyvol        daily share volume -- Beaver's volume measure
#   dlyprc        price, for computing market value
#   shrout        shares outstanding, for turnover (volume / shares)
#   primaryexch   exchange, so we can impose Beaver's NYSE-only screen
#   sharetype /
#   securitytype  common-stock screens
#
# A NOTE ON CRSP "v2" (the CIZ format): WRDS migrated CRSP to a new schema.
# Column names changed (dlycaldt not date, dlyret not ret) and the old
# integer codes were replaced by strings. In particular the old `exchcd`
# (1 = NYSE) is now `primaryexch` ('N' = NYSE, 'A' = NYSE American,
# 'Q' = Nasdaq). These identifiers live on the daily file itself, which is
# convenient: we can screen on exchange and share type directly, with no
# date-range join to a separate names table.
#
# We apply the common-stock screen server-side because it discards funds,
# ADRs, and other non-common securities that Beaver's design never
# contemplated -- that is a big row reduction for free. We deliberately do
# NOT filter on exchange here, so you can relax the NYSE screen in script
# 2 without re-downloading.

# Download the CRSP market index -----------------------------------------------

# indno 1000200 is the CRSP value-weighted index covering
# NYSE/NYSE American/Nasdaq/Arca. dlytotret is its total return.
